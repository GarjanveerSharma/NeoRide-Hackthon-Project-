# NeoRide-Hackthon-Project-

NeoRide is a safety-focused ride-booking web application developed during my first hackathon. This project combines essential ride-booking features with enhanced 
safety measures to ensure a secure and user-friendly experience. NeoRide allows users to book rides by entering pickup and drop-off locations, choose ride types, and 
view live ride status updates. It includes real-time location tracking, ETA countdown, and a powerful SOS Emergency feature that notifies trusted contacts instantly 
in case of danger. Built with modern web technologies and a clean, intuitive interface, NeoRide is a step toward making digital transportation services more 
responsible, accessible, and safe for everyone.
